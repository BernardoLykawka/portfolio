        "wbdDescription": "During my fourth semester at the Experimental Software Engineering Agency (AGES), I developed the \"WBD+ Social Impact Monitoring\" platform for WimBelemDon. The system integrates a database for continuous recording of students' attendance and assessments, with a dashboard and custom reports that support pedagogical and institutional management through quantitative and qualitative indicators.\n\nThe solution uses React on the frontend and NestJS on the backend, ensuring scalability and performance, and connects academic development with real social impact.",
        "luckyDrawDescription": "During my third semester, I developed \"Lucky Draw\" within the Experimental Software Engineering Agency (AGES), an immersive academic course designed to simulate a professional software environment. The app addresses creative block by gamifying the artistic process with random, tarot-inspired drawing themes.\n\n As a Fullstack developer, We built the mobile interface using React Native and a robust API with Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, utilizing Docker for environment orchestration. This project was pivotal in refining my technical skills and collaborative abilities in a team setting."
